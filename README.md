# DigitsDimensionalityReduction
A project to reduce Dimensionality in Scikit Learn's digit dataset. <br />
Classification algorithms will be applied to the reduced Dimensionality and accuracies will be compared.<br />
Classification Algorithms used: KNN, Random Forest<br />
Accuracy achieved: 98% <br />
